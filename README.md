OMG, just got out of Creation of the Gods II: Demon Force... and holy moly, my head is spinning faster than a washing machine with a brick in it 😂. I can’t tell if it’s the   or if sitting on these benches is wrecking my back rn, but — wow. Okay, so, first things first: the sound. It was like being inside an exploding popcorn machine with extra bass, like, I’m pretty sure I’ve got popcorn crumbs in my hair now? Or maybe it’s shiny pieces? idk.

But then the scenes with the demons! My god, there were demons everywhere, just swarming like those ants that find sugar in the most inconvenient places. You know what that’s like. And these battles!! There was this one part, fire flaring like what’s supposed to be the apocalypse probably, and I’m sitting there thinking—did did someone say we could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Now, those glowing eyes, like jellybeans with a mean streak, ya know? Unsettling.

> Somewhere about halfway through, I was wondering if I'd be into it more if I’d had two caffeinated slushies instead of one. Maybe it’s 'cause I just wanted to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   home with the quiet and no rustling Hershey's wrappers right behind me. Gosh, the shoddy logic of it all kinda reminded me of grandma trying her hand at Spotify playlists but ending up just with whale noises and jazz, which is impressively chaotic, actually.

Did I tell you? The noisy theater almost made me miss that heart-stopping climax — big swords and majesty and people screaming (screen and real life). Who writes this stuff like it’s a Shakespearean fever dream? But man, that CGI, it felt like those childhood kaleidoscopes—spinning and twisting but somehow kicking you into a magical world, except less soothing and more “is tiptoeing demons an art form?”

I'm sure there was a cliffhanger too but I got so distracted when I dropped my phone, nearly 2000 times more interesting than the actual ending. Talking about distractions, what if pandas suddenly decided they hate bamboo? A random thought, but kind of like the odd surprises this   throws at you.

```python
def  _experience():
    if sound and lights and fire > concentration:
        feel(headspinning=True)
    return thoughts_jumbled > coherence
# Why did I write this? 🤨
